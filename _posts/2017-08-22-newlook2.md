We've moved from our old Wordpress blog to a new one hosted on Github Pages
powered by Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes!

In the days to come, I will update the blog with some of the tutorials I have
released in the past years as well as produce more content on the vulnerability
research I have been doing.

It's been a good 5 years running the blog and I intend to keep it running for a
lot longer.

Thanks for reading.
