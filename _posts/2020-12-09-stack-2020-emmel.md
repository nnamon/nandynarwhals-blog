DESCRIPTION
Investigators have found a curious login page on a server belonging to COViD. Can you get past the login screen?

Login Page (http://yhi8bpzolrog3yw17fe0wlwrnwllnhic.alttablabs.sg:40751/)
```

Visiting the login page shows us a file prompt for a JPG image and the question 'What is my favorite thing?'.

![Login Prompt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/stack-2020/C991E857B2AD3AB816577EE2FDA56F3F.jpg){:. align-center}

Attempting this random image of a dickbutt that I had lying around on my hard drive gives us a message but does not log us in.

![dickbutt.jpg]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/stack-2020/1CB9AFA3E201F3C0CAE6C3E5AEEFEEA3.jpg){:. align-center}

However, the message appears promising: 'Error, you must get 50% or higher! Similarity: 30.75%'. This implies that we are dealing with an image classifier and we have to submit an image that passes the threshold for identification.

![Not similar enough to log in]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/stack-2020/52A5DC48C091E3C5887D4D461180A73E.jpg =764x352){:. align-center}

Since the similarity value is pretty decent for the initial random image, another dickbutt image is attempted:

![dickbutt3.jpg]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/stack-2020/C5118FBDD2EFB46026BA4A870DD07012.jpg =742x800){:. align-center}

This time, the image is similar enough and logs us in, granting us the flag:

![Dickbutt accepted]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/stack-2020/46B7ACE681BD36C1F48C09685B42E66F.jpg){: .align-center}

It appears that the expected image was supposed to be of a dog, but the threshold was set too low to actually recognise it. Anyway, we got our flag and can move on.

**Flag:** `govtech-csg{I_L0V3_G00D_D0GG0S!}`
