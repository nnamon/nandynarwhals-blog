I participated with the NUS Greyhats in this year's [HITBGSEC CTF
2017](https://ctftime.org/event/498). It was organised by the HITB Netherlands
CTF team and the XCTF League crew. It ran extremely smoothly and the challenges
were varied and difficult.

The [NUS Greyhats](https://nusgreyhats.org) came in 5th against 185 competing
teams all around the World.
