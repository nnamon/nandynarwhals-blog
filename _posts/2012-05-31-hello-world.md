Back in May 2012, the first post by Hiromi was "NANDNANDNANDNAND".

I thought I would give it a little more class with this re-release of the Nandy
Narwhals blog now serving both the Nandy Narwhals and Dystopian Narwhals CTF
teams as well as my personal information security projects.

I will be migrating the entire site to this platform over the next couple of
days.
